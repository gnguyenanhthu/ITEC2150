There are actually several ways to read and write from text files using the Java API classes. 
We are going to look at two common ways to do so. Text files typically consist of human readable characters. 
When dealing with lines of text, the easiest class to use for reading those lines of text in is the BufferedReader class. 
The associated output class for writing to files is known as BufferedWriter. There are limitations with these classes due to the fact 
that they can only read or write lines of text.
This file contains 6 lines and 558 characters.
